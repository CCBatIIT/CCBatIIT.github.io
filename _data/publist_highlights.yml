  description: We have written software to precisely estimate the binding potential of mean force (BPMF), the binding free energy between a flexible ligand and a rigid receptor. The BPMF is a critical ingredient for esimating binding free energies with implicit ligand theory.

  description: We have shown how to use constrained molecular dynamics, such as torsional dynamics, as a Monte Carlo move for molecular simulation. Previously, molecular simulations based on constrained dynamics would not sample from the appropriate distribution or not sample the entirely of configuration space.

  description: We have shown that if there are a sufficient number of states in a replica exchange simulation, the precise definition of states does not affect sampling efficiency. Previously, many scientists thought that the number of states in replica exchange should be carefully optimized.
