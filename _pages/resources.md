# Source code and data

We have contributed source code and data to repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/ccbatiit/) and [SimTK](https://simtk.org/).

## Related to publications

* [AlGDock](https://github.com/ccbatiit/algdock/) is our main code to estimate the binding potential of mean force, the binding free energy between a flexible small molecules and a rigid protein. This is a key part of estimating the standard binding free energy using implicit ligand theory. It is described in [Journal of Computational Chemistry 41, 715–730 (2020)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jcc.26036).

* [A symmetric estimator for nonequilibrium path-ensemble averages](https://github.com/nguyentrunghai/Nonequilibrium), as described in [Journal of Chemical Physics 151, 194103 (2019)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.5121306).

* [BPMFwFFT](https://github.com/nguyentrunghai/BPMFwFFT) is a code to estimate the binding PMF based on the Fast Fourier transform. It is described in [Journal of Computational Chemistry 39, 621–636 (2018)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jcc.25139).

* [bitc](https://github.com/choderalab/bayesian-itc) is code from John Chodera’s group for the Bayesian analysis of isothermal titration calorimetry experiments, as described in [PloS One 13, e0203224 (2018)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0203224).

* [An estimator for relative binding free energy calculations based on implicit ligand theory](https://github.com/nguyentrunghai/ILT_Relative), as described in [Journal of Chemical Physics 148, 104114 (2018)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.5017136).

* [An estimator for absolute binding free energy calculations based on implicit ligand theory](https://simtk.org/home/implicit_ligand), as described in [Journal of Chemical Physics 137, 104106 (2012)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4751284).

* [MATLAB code for analyzing biased experiments](https://simtk.org/home/ferbe), as described in [Journal of Physical Chemistry B 111, 4137–4140 (2007)](https://doi.org/10.1021/jp068656n) and [Physical Review E 74, 61120 (2006)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.74.061120).

## Related to classes

David has taught an advanced undergraduate class on computational chemistry and drug design and made [resources including lecture notes](https://daveminh.github.io/Chem456/) and [website code](https://github.com/daveminh/Chem456) available.

David has also worked with interprofessional project (IPRO) groups at Illinois Tech to develop a <a title="https://github.com/gkumar7/AlGDock" href="https://github.com/gkumar7/AlGDock">web-based graphical user interface for AlGDock</a>. An IPRO team has also developed <a title="https://github.com/Aczopek/Ipro-spring-2016" href="https://github.com/Aczopek/Ipro-spring-2016">image analysis for ball-and-stick models to generate chemical graphs</a>, which may be used for interactive exercises in organic chemistry.

# Recommended software
<!-- TODO: Update based on workshop -->

## Programming languages and academic software

[Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/) - the Python programming language is widely used in the scientific community. It includes many packages for data analysis and visualization. Anaconda provides a high-quality management of virtual environments.

[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) - It can be difficult to keep track of the scientific papers that you've read and would like to cite in your own articles. Zotero is a free reference manager that will organize files for you and generate bibliographies. It interfaces with word processors like Microsoft Word and Google Drive, among others.

## Molecular modeling

[Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD)](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) - molecular visualization code, specialized for molecular dynamics trajectories. The [“Using VMD”](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/vmd-index.html) tutorial is a good starting point.

[Not Another Molecular Dynamics (NAMD)](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/) - molecular dynamics code, with nice documentation and tutorials.  Most relevant to the group are the [molecular dynamics tutorial](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/namd-index.html#namdtut), and the tutorials on [protein:ligand standard binding free energies and alchemical free energy perturbation](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/freenergy-index.html).
