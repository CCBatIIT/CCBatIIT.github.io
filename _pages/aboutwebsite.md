This website was adapted from the Allan Lab
[website](https://www.allanlab.org/)
[code](https://github.com/allanlab/allanlab).
The Allan released the website under the MIT license and
provided nice documentation on how to modify their website.
The template was also modified to include a blog,
as described in [a guide to GitHub pages](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).
