* [AlGDock](https://github.com/ccbatiit/algdock/) is our main code to estimate the binding potential of mean force, the binding free energy between a flexible small molecules and a rigid protein. This is a key part of estimating the standard binding free energy using implicit ligand theory. It is described in [Journal of Computational Chemistry 41, 715–730 (2020)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jcc.26036).

* [BPMFwFFT](https://github.com/nguyentrunghai/BPMFwFFT) is a code to estimate the binding PMF based on the Fast Fourier transform. It is described in [Journal of Computational Chemistry 39, 621–636 (2018)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jcc.25139).

I have worked with interprofessional project (IPRO) groups at Illinois Tech to develop a <a title="https://github.com/gkumar7/AlGDock" href="https://github.com/gkumar7/AlGDock">web-based graphical user interface for AlGDock</a>. An IPRO team has also developed <a title="https://github.com/Aczopek/Ipro-spring-2016" href="https://github.com/Aczopek/Ipro-spring-2016">image analysis for ball-and-stick models to generate chemical graphs</a>, which may be used for interactive exercises in organic chemistry.
