**Note: We currently don't have funding for additional PhD and postdoc positions. We can only welcome you if you have a fellowship.**

We are always on the lookout for qualified and motivated team members. Interested candidates for all positions should submit a cover letter and curriculum vitae to Dr. David Minh (david dot minh at iit dot edu).  Postdoctoral candidates should also submit contact information for 2-3 references.

* Postdoctoral positions are periodically available. Salary will be commensurate to experience. We are interested in supporting fellowship applications for competitive scholars.

* Current M.S. and Ph.D. students at Illinois Tech will be considered.

* Prospective M.S. and Ph.D. students should express interest in our group in their applications and also contact Dr. Minh.

* Current undergraduate students are accepted from all degree programs at the Illinois Institute of Technology. Additionally, many undergraduates have visited for summer internships.

* High school students may be considered for summer internships.
