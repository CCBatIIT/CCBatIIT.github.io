Our group is actively working in several areas.

### Methods for faster and more accurate binding free energy calculations

Unlike fast molecular docking methods, our new methods consider entropy as well as the enthalpy of binding. We derive new theories that enable computational shortcuts to rigorous binding free energy calculations. We also develop and test computer software that implements the new theory.

### Techniques to enhance sampling in molecular simulations

Simulations do not need to mimic motion on an atomic scale in order to sample configurations from the proper equilibrium distribution. We are implementing and testing new types of Monte Carlo moves.

### Chemometric methods for integrating and analyzing measurement data from multiple sources

We are writing statistical analysis packages based on Bayesian statistics (the foundation of deep learning) to combine binding-related data from multiple measurements and instruments. The programs will also propose new experiments that maximize information gain.

### Application of molecular modeling to biomedical problems

In collaboration with Oscar Juarez from the biology department, we are currently focusing on modeling metabolic enzymes from pathogenic bacteria. We are studying redox-induced conformational changes and the binding of metabolites and inhibitors. We plan to screen for and optimize new inhibitors as potential antibiotics.
