I've completed a major renovation and update of the group website. It was adapted from the Allan Lab
[[website](https://www.allanlab.org/)] [[code](https://github.com/allanlab/allanlab)]. The Allan lab released the website under the MIT license and provided nice documentation on how to modify their website. Thank you!

The template was also modified to include a blog, as described in [a guide to GitHub pages](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). I'm hoping to use the blog to post findings or opinions that others may find valuable but are too small for research papers.
